# CMP3060-Raptor-Project-

For my disseration I decided to make an app about raptors (birds of prey) and how gamification would increase user interaction, so they could learn
how to identify raptors and how to protect them.

The app was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery which was built and compiled using Apache Cordova and Adobe PhoneGap. 

- Disclaimer - 
Adobe has discontinued PhoneGap and ended investment in Apache Cordova so this app will no longer work as intended, but as it was made using HTML & CSS it will work in the browser, also some features will no longer work. Because of this I am in the process of finding another alternative to PhoneGap aswell as completely rebuilding the app using Xamarin
